Features :
	I have used same features as provided in starter script. After analyzing Found some features are not important.
	like ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','Science','Hockey','Wildlife','Reality','Badminton','Travel','Thriller','Horror','dow_count'].
	so Removed them.
	Also found 'title_count' is not too normalized.So apply log transformation.

Machine learning Model - 
	I have apply XGBClassifier().Also tune parameter found at learning rate 0.2 model performanance is optimal.
	I hava also plot learning curves for n_estimators ,learning_rate.

Files Information- 
	1.) Hotstar_XGBOOST_Script.ipynb , all preprocessing steps and training code reside in this.
	2.) XG_Final.csv - model prediction over testing data.
